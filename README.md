# File_Transfer_Protocol_Example
Server Client based FTP over a Python Socket connection

This FTP works over a reestablished direct LAN connection, and does not support any encryption nor error detection/correction.

This is an oversimplified example of how to create a simple FTP using python sockets.

For testing purposes, Run Server first, then start up Client on separate PC that is connected via Ethernet cable directly to the Server machine. The connection will establish automatically. 

When prompted, Username can be anything. As for password, it requires that you enter a University of South Alabama .Edu email. Simply incert “a@jagmail.southalabama.edu” and you with authenticate.
